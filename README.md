# Hello. I am Rob. :wave:

This is my GitHub README. I will try to keep helpful, relevant, or interesting things here.

## About me

I enjoy the extremes of either being hyper-connected to everything tech/digital or being completely disconnected from everything. I take at least one major backpacking trip per year and would love to visit every national park in my lifetime. I love sci-fi books, films, and music enjoy everything of the [synthwave](https://ironskullet.com/2018/03/01/what-is-synthwave-2018-edition/)/[cyberpunk](https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/8/30/17796680/cyberpunk-2077-history-blade-runner-neuromancer) variety. I'm from the U.S. but originally Romanian. I graduated undergrad with a dual degree--Bachelor of Science in both Mathematics and Computer Science from [CCSU](https://www.ccsu.edu/), where I wrote a hybrid CS/Econ thesis in 2014 on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies (no, I'm not a Bitcoin billionaire--I was too broke at the time to invest in crypto).

I am currently working professionally in software engineering in the financial industry. I work with automation for deployment and configuration of enterprise-scale systems.
