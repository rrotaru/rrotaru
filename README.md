# Hello. I am Rob. :wave:

This is my GitHub README. I will try to keep helpful, relevant, or interesting things here.

## About me

I enjoy the extremes of either being hyper-connected to everything tech/digital or being completely disconnected from everything. I'm an avid backpacker, a keyboard enthusiast who dabbles in DIY projects, and a novice guitarist. I enjoy everything of the [synthwave](https://medium.com/@cywjoel/outrun-the-aesthetic-deconstructed-dbd3cd8679b7)/[cyberpunk](https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/8/30/17796680/cyberpunk-2077-history-blade-runner-neuromancer) variety. I graduated undergrad with a dual degree--Bachelor of Science in both Mathematics and Computer Science from [CCSU](https://www.ccsu.edu/) where I wrote a thesis on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies--no, I'm not a Bitcoin billionaire, I was too broke at the time (2014) to invest in crypto.

I am currently working professionally in software engineering in the financial industry. I work with automation for deployment and configuration of enterprise-scale systems.
